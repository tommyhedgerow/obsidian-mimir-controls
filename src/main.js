/*
 * The Mimir controls — two buttons in the top bar of a note: reading size, and frame.
 *
 * TWO BUTTONS, NO PANEL. An earlier version put both settings in a small card that opened
 * from a ribbon icon. That is one press too many for two settings that are switched often,
 * and it hid the state behind the press. Now each control is its own button in the bar at
 * the top of the note, beside its title: the mark shows the state, pressing gives the next
 * one, and nothing opens.
 *
 *   size    a type mark with three pips beside it. One pip filled = small, medium, large.
 *           Left-click steps forward through 15 / 16.5 / 18.5 px; right-click steps back.
 *   frame   a sun or a moon, showing the light or dark you are reading in. Press to swap.
 *
 * WHERE THE BUTTONS GO, AND WHERE THEY DO NOT
 *   In the view header, which is the app's own bar for a pane. The plugin's first attempt
 *   moved Obsidian's left ribbon into a horizontal rail instead, which took a row from the
 *   app's layout and pushed the workspace down. Nothing is moved now: the ribbon is where
 *   Obsidian puts it, no other button is touched, and if this plugin is disabled the bar is
 *   exactly as it was.
 *
 * WHAT IT TOUCHES
 *   Two of Obsidian's own settings, both reversible by hand in Settings → Appearance:
 *   `theme` (moonstone | obsidian) and `baseFontSize` (the three sizes in
 *   Tools/mimir-tokens.json). It writes no file and keeps no state of its own; it reads the
 *   live settings before every paint, so a change made in Appearance shows up here at once.
